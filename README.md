Washing Machine Queue Control System 🧺📟
This project implements a real-time embedded system designed to manage a queue of users for a shared washing machine in institutional hostels. It solves the problem of disorganized access by using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue system with real-time user notifications.

💡 Features
RTOS-based queue management for up to 5 users

User registration via 4x4 keypad and LCD interface

Hall sensor detects wash cycle completion

Contact sensor (or push-button) confirms laundry pickup/drop

Serial communication to notify users in their rooms (LED blinking)

Circular queue implemented in assembly with RAM optimization

Interrupt-driven control flow (INT0 and INT1 on 8051 MCU)

🧰 Tech Stack
Microcontroller: 8051 (AT89S52)

Language: Embedded C, Assembly

Simulation: Proteus

Hardware: Hall Sensor, Keypad, LCD, Logic Gates, Decoder (74HC138)

CAD: SolidWorks (for mechanical chassis design)
